**TL;DR** I'm going to write as much as I can about things that I learn.

>The purpose of software is to help people.

This is something that I'm trying to internalize for the past few months. Writing
software to help other people, and even myself, has not always been the primary
reason why I do it. I write code because I find
the activity itself fun. Learning new stuff and being able to express my
thoughts into a language a machine can understand makes coding fun for me.
Now, I'm trying to change that motivation into something that for me has more
meaning.

So as part of this change, I plan to post some of stuff that hopefully would
be helpful to other people, probably my notes on issues that I encountered, or
my learnings that come out of my Google/stackoverflow searches.

#### Possible Topics

I'm not entirely sure how to go about this but here's a list of possible topics
I'm thinking of writing about:

- My experience using ReactiveCocoa
- My experience using Ansible
- How to animate using NSLayoutConstraint, and later, MASConstraint
- How to modify the title bar of an NSWindow (Have to research how first)
- My plan on learning Go language and its ecosystem, or other languages that
  I'm interested in, such as Haskell.

Again, I'm not sure if my methods/solutions/workarounds to the issues I face
with are correct. Nevertheless, I'm going to try sharing them. And hopefully,
it'll help someone.
